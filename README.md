12 Git Commands I Use 99% of the Time as a Software Developer

1. git init: This magic spell breathes life into a new Git repository, transforming your project folder into a version-controlled wonderland.

2. git clone: Use git clone to download a complete repository from a remote server, allowing you to tinker and contribute.

3. git status: git status acts as your compass, revealing the current state of your files (modified, staged, or untracked).

4. git add: git add prepares your modified files to be part of the next commit.

5. git commit: git commit creates a snapshot of your project, capturing the added or modified files along with a meaningful commit message (choose wisely!).

6. git push: Collaboration is key! After committing, git push sends your changes to a remote repository (like GitHub) for others to access.

7. git pull: git pull fetches updates from the remote repository and merges them into your local copy.

8. git branch: git branch lets you create new branches to experiment with features without affecting the main project.

9. git checkout: git checkout allows you to seamlessly navigate between different development paths.

10. git merge: git merge integrates your feature branch with the main branch, resolving any conflicts that may arise.

11. git diff: git diff reveals the differences between files, branches, or commits.

12. git log: History buffs rejoice! git log provides a detailed chronological record of all your commits, allowing you to revisit past versions and understand project evolution.

Mastering these Git commands will significantly enhance your productivity and collaboration in software development.
